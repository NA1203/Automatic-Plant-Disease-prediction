#Plant Disease Prediction
This project focuses on creating a model to detect plant diseases early, aiming to reduce crop losses. 
By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and image preprocessing techniques for feature extraction, the project aims to enhance the accuracy of disease prediction.
Additionally, transfer learning with pre-trained models is implemented to improve the model's performance.

Features
  1) Disease Detection: Identifies various plant diseases from images.
  2) Image Preprocessing: Includes resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
  3) Transfer Learning: Utilizes pre-trained models to improve prediction accuracy.
